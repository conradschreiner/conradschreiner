- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @conradschreiner
- I currently work as a Data Analyst focused on data quality and normalization issues on a enterprise level database at a large corporation.
- I'm in my second quarter of Oregon State University's Postbacc Computer Science Program. Most of my work here in the short term here will involve course work related to that degree.
- Python and SQL are my two main skillsets but I'm excited to learn more as I progress through my degree and career in general!
